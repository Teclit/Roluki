# Code Optimization Changes

## Shared Navigation Data Refactoring

### Summary
Refactored shared navigation-related data into a dedicated file to improve code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

### Changes Made

1. **Created a new shared data file**
   - Created `src/app/shared/navigation-data.ts` to centralize navigation-related data
   - Moved the duplicated `NavItem` interface to this shared file
   - Added a utility function `getCurrentYear()` to get the current year
   - Created constants for navigation items in both English and French

2. **Updated Footer Component**
   - Imported the shared `NavItem` interface, `FRENCH_NAV_ITEMS`, and `getCurrentYear` function
   - Removed the local `NavItem` interface definition
   - Replaced hardcoded navigation items with `FRENCH_NAV_ITEMS`
   - Replaced direct date calculation with `getCurrentYear()`

3. **Updated Navbar Component**
   - Imported the shared `NavItem` interface and `ENGLISH_NAV_ITEMS`
   - Removed the local `NavItem` interface definition
   - Replaced hardcoded navigation items with `ENGLISH_NAV_ITEMS`

### Benefits

1. **Improved Code Organization**
   - Related data is now grouped together in a dedicated file
   - Reduced code duplication across components

2. **Enhanced Reusability**
   - Navigation items and utility functions can be easily reused in other components
   - Changes to navigation structure only need to be made in one place

3. **Better Maintainability**
   - Centralized location for navigation-related data makes future updates easier
   - Reduced risk of inconsistencies between components

4. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Components now focus on their specific functionality
   - Data management is separated from component logic
